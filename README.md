## Timetable Management System
A basic console-based Timetable Management System designed to manage academic timetables efficiently.

The system supports two modes:

- Admin Mode:
  Allows the admin to add and delete slots, while the system automatically detects timetable clashes and discards conflicting entries.

- Student Mode:
  Allows students to search timetables by teacher, section, or classroom for a specific day.

The system uses file handling to load data such as teachers, courses, classrooms, and admin information, and stores this data in efficient data structures for fast searching, insertion, deletion, and collision handling.

All stored slots are loaded when the program starts, and any changes are saved to `Files/Slots.txt` when the program exits.
